I am trying to replicate a simple shopping cart without connection to the database, We also created a simple summary cart which you can see the selected Items and total amount. Once the Cart is ready we can proceed to the Checkout which uses CreditCart as our Payment Gateway. 

## Tools

- Laravel Framework 
- Vuejs
- Bootstrap 
- Axios
- luigel/laravel-paymongo - Payment Gateway Integration 
- vue-credit-card-validation - CreditCard validation 

## Data

- Array of products 

## Security

CSRF Protection

## About 

- Simple shopping cart page with Add to cart and checkout functionality.
- CreditCard form (Paymongo) uses PayMongo Payment Gateway
